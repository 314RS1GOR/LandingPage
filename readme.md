# Landing Page Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) **Foundations** course. The goal is to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills by building a landing page from scratch.

## Project Overview

This project had the following objectives:
- Build a landing page similar to many product or service landing pages you see on the web.
- Apply essential HTML and CSS concepts like structure, layout, and basic styling.
- Focus on writing clean, maintainable code with a responsive design in mind.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The landing page should look good on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Navigation Bar:** A simple navigation bar with links to different sections of the page.
- **Hero Section:** A bold section that grabs the userâ€™s attention.
- **Content Sections:** Additional sections containing text and images to showcase a product, service, or any other content.
- **Footer:** A footer with links to social media or other pages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Requirements

### 1. Structure
- The page should include a header, main content sections, and a footer.
- Use semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.

### 2. Layout
- Use Flexbox or Grid to position elements on the page.
- The layout should adjust for different screen sizes (responsive design).

### 3. Styling
- Include at least one custom font (e.g., from Google Fonts).
- Use CSS to add colors, spacing, and basic hover effects.
- Create a cohesive and visually pleasing design.

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced:
- Structuring a web page with HTML.
- Using CSS for layouts, especially Flexbox.
- Implementing responsive design techniques.
